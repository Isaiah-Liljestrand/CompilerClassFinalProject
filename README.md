--Coding Standards--
Java based\n
Use branches for editing\n
Merge branches that work\n
Mostly following Google’s Java style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\n
8 Spaces will be used instead of tabs.\n
Braces will always be used even when the body contains only one line.\n
Braces will be placed on the same line for if, else, for, while, and any other statements which need brackets.\n
Both braces for an empty block can be placed on the same line for conciseness.\n
Identifier names must match the regular expression “\w+”. Only ascii letters and digits.\n
Package names are all lower case.\n
Class names use UpperCamelCase.\n
Method names use lowerCamelCase.\n
Constant names use all capitals with each word separated by an underscore.\n
Parameter and local variable names use lowerCamelCase.\n
Type variable names will use the form used by classes followed by a capital T.\n
